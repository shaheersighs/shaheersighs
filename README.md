**ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Shaheer Khan**


I'm a final-year Data Engineering student who loves wrangling data, optimizing workflows, and building projects that do the heavy lifting. 


**Me and My Projects**


Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Engineering at TAFE NSW, diving deep into Python, SQL, and big data technologies. 

1 - Built a Flight Management System using OOP and data structuresâ€”because who doesnâ€™t love sorting algorithms and binary trees? 

2 - Developed an AI-powered Tech Resume Aanlyzer with NLP to make job hunting (and hiring) a little less painful. 

3 - Created a Counterfeit Currency Detection System using computer vision and deep learningâ€”because counterfeiters should really find another hobby. 

4 - Built an ML model network anomaly detection because even anomalies deserves good predictions. 

5 - Developed a Deep Learning for model brain tumour classification because math can save lives.
