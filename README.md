**👋 Hey, I'm Shaheer Khan**


I'm a Data Engineering who loves wrangling data, optimizing workflows, and building ML projects that do the heavy lifting. 


**Me and My Projects**


Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Engineering at TAFE NSW, diving deep into Python, SQL, and big data technologies. 

1 - Humanai, AI to Human “editor” that rewrites LLM-generated text into more human-like writing while preserving meaning and original intent.

2 - Built a Flight Management System using OOP and data structures—because who doesn’t love sorting algorithms and binary trees? 

3 - Developed an AI-powered Tech Resume Aanlyzer with NLP to make job hunting (and hiring) a little less painful. 

4 - Created a Counterfeit Currency Detection System using computer vision and deep learning—because counterfeiters should really find another hobby. 

5 - Built an ML model network anomaly detection because even anomalies deserves good predictions. 

6 - Developed a Deep Learning for model brain tumour classification because math can save lives.
