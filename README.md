**👋 Hey, I'm Shaheer Khan**


I'm a final-year Data Engineering student who loves wrangling data, optimizing workflows, and building projects that do the heavy lifting. 🚀


**Me and My Projects**


Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Engineering at TAFE NSW, diving deep into Python, SQL, and big data technologies. 🎓 

Built a Flight Management System using OOP and data structures—because who doesn’t love sorting algorithms and binary trees? 🛫

Developed an AI-powered Resume Screening Tool with NLP to make job hunting (and hiring) a little less painful. 🔍📄

Created a Fake Currency Detection System using computer vision and deep learning—because counterfeiters should really find another hobby. 💵🚫

Built an ML Model for Soil Health—because even dirt deserves good predictions. 🏡🌾

Developed a Logistic Regression Model for Stroke Prediction—because math can save lives. 🧠❤️
